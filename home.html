            <h4 class="user-header">User 1</h4>
            <p class="answer">Aimed to make use of the fan's extensive settings. Used copious trial & error in order to find the perfect configuration.</p>

          <div class="bordered user-2">
            <h4 class="user-header">User 2</h4>
            <p class="answer">Found the interface largely unfamiliar, unclear, and confusing. Strongly preferred the on-fan interface over the remote.</p>

          <div class="bordered user-3">
            <h4 class="user-header">User 3</h4>
            <p class="answer">Owns a similar fan, albeit with a somewhat different interface. Was able to master the interface quickly, with minimal confusion.</p>

        <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
        <div class="bordered question">
          <h4>On a scale from 1 (least) to 10 (most), how approachable did you initially find the interface? Why?</h4>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="bordered user-1">
              <p class="answer">7. I was pretty comfortable with the look of it, but I knew I would probably get some things wrong at first.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-2">
              <p class="answer">5. There were only five buttons, so I felt that it would not be too challenging to learn. But, it was unclear what each button's purpose was, and it didn't help that two of them look the same.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-3">
              <p class="answer">7. It mostly fit my expectations, but there were a couple of buttons that were a mystery to me at first.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bordered question">
          <h4>Compared to your initial impression of the interface, did any part(s) of the interface catch you by surprise? If so, which part(s) and why?</h4>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="bordered user-1">
              <p class="answer">I'm still not quite sure why the "mode" setting is necessary, but I wouldn't say I was "suprised" by it per se. Before you told me, I couldn't really tell what that button was doing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-2">
              <p class="answer">The display was smaller than I thought it would be, and I was not expecting it to turn off after I didn't press any buttons for a few seconds. The way the timer was displayed felt weird too.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-3">
              <p class="answer">I was pleasantly surprised that when I turned it off and on again, it kept the same settings I had before.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bordered question">
          <h4>On a scale from 1 (easy) to 10 (hard), how difficult was it to quickly grasp the fan's functionality? Why?</h4>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="bordered user-1">
              <p class="answer">6. I had to go through the settings a couple times to get the hang of it. I wish the display had words on it instead of icons that I needed to interpret.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-2">
              <p class="answer">6. There wasn't a ton to grasp, but I couldn't tell what some of the icons meant. And to be honest, I would still have to guess which button is which [between "strength" and "mode"].</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-3">
              <p class="answer">3. It wasn't too bad at all, other than the buttons being hard to tell apart. I was able to grasp everything within a minute or so.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bordered question">
          <h4>Were there any specific elements of the interface that made it easy to achieve your desired settings? If so, which one(s) and why?</h4>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="bordered user-1">
              <p class="answer">Overall, it wasn't too bad once I got the hang of it. But, at first it took a little more work than I expected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-2">
              <p class="answer">The timer and swivel buttons were pretty obvious, but the timer was pretty much ruined by the way it's displayed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-3">
              <p class="answer">Nothing in particular, although, like I said before, it's nice that my settings were maintained after I turned it off.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bordered question">
          <h4>Were there any specific elements of the interface that made it difficult to achieve your desired settings? If so, which one(s) and why?</h4>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="bordered user-1">
              <p class="answer">Before you told me what each icon meant, I had to put my hand in front of the fan to test for myself, since the icons were unclear. Especially for the "mode" setting.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-2">
              <p class="answer">The icons were so small that they were hard to see from across the room when I was using the remote. Also, the display turned off quickly so I couldn't see my settings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-3">
              <p class="answer">The timer should not be a cycle; I overshot the time I wanted and had to press the button 7 more times to decrease it by an hour.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bordered question">
          <h4>Were there any differences between your experience using the on-fan interface, and using the remote? If so, please elaborate.</h4>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="bordered user-1">
              <p class="answer">Not really. If I <em>had</em> to think of something, when I turned on the oscillation with the button on the fan, the buttons of course started moving, which made it a little harder to use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-2">
              <p class="answer">I like the idea of the remote, but it was harder to use because I couldn't see the icons very well from across the room. The remote should have its own display of the current settings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-3">
              <p class="answer">The remote is a really nice feature. I didn't find either one too different from the other.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bordered question">
          <h4>Are there any changes to the interface that you would suggest? If so, which one(s) and why?</h4>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="bordered user-1">
              <p class="answer">The display, and the buttons, should definitely have words instead of just the icons. It looks cool the way it is, but it's more confusing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-2">
              <p class="answer">The display should remain on by default, and there should be a button to turn it on and off. The icons should be bigger and the remote should have its own display. The timer should be displayed as one number.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bordered user-3">
              <p class="answer">The timer should have smaller increments than 1 hour, and should have increase and decrease functionality instead of a cycle.</p>

      <strong>Note:</strong> Interview responses are not exact quotes from the users; they are paraphrased and shortened into summaries. Users were told to at least experiment with each setting in order to experience the entirety of the interface
      (otherwise, the users probably would not have tried the timer in these short interviews).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> This interface is well-suited for both public and private view. User interviews and observations were conducted in public view; the storyboard takes place in private view because that scenario better aligns with Precise
      Pete's archetypal use-case. The photos in the storyboard are my own recreation of Precise Pete's hypothetical usage of the product.
